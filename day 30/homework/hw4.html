<h2>ABOUT BRAND</h2>
<article>
    <div>
        <p>A brand is a name, term, design, symbol
             or any other feature that distinguishes
              one seller's good or service from those of other sellers.
              Brands are used in business, marketing, and advertising for recognition and, importantly,
               to create and store value as brand equity for the object identified, to the benefit of the brand's customers, 
               its owners and shareholders. Brand names are sometimes distinguished from generic or store brands.

            The practice of branding—in the original literal sense of marking by burning—is thought to 
            have begun with the ancient Egyptians, who are known to have engaged 
            in livestock branding and branded slaves as early as 2,700 BCE.
             Branding was used to differentiate one person's cattle from another's by means of a 
             distinctive symbol burned into the animal's skin with a hot branding iron. If a person stole any 
             of the cattle, anyone else who saw the symbol could deduce the actual owner. The term has been extended
              to mean a strategic personality for a product or company, so that "brand" now 
              suggests the values and promises that a consumer may perceive and buy into. 
              It includes the voice and the tonality of the business. Over time, 
              the practice of branding objects extended to a broader range of
               packaging and goods offered for sale including oil, wine, cosmetics, 
               and fish sauce and, in the 21st century, extends even 
               further into services (such as legal, financial and medical),
                political parties and people (e.g. Lady Gaga and Katy Perry).
                 Branding in terms of painting a cow with symbols or colors at 
                 flea markets was considered to be one of the oldest forms of the practice.</p>
