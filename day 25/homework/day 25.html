<center><h1><b>Computer programming
</b></h1></center>
<p>Computer programming or  is the composition of sequences
     of instructions, called programs, that computers can follow
      to perform tasks.[1][2] It involves designing and implementing algorithms, 
      step-by-step specifications of procedures, by writing code in one or more
       programming languages. Programmers typically use high-level programming languages 
       that are more easily intelligible to humans than machine code, which is directly
        executed by the central processing unit. Proficient programming usually requires
         expertise in several different subjects, including knowledge of the application 
         domain, details of programming languages and generic code libraries, specialized 
         algorithms, and formal logic.Auxiliary tasks accompanying and related to programming 
         include analyzing requirements, testing, debugging (investigating and fixing problems),
         implementation of build systems, and management of derived artifacts, such as programs'
          machine code. While these are sometimes considered programming, often the term software
           development is used for this larger overall process â€“ with the terms programming, implementation, 
           and coding reserved for the writing and editing of code per se. Sometimes software development is
            known as software engineering, especially when it employs formal methods or follows an engineering
             design process.</p>

             <p>Programmable devices have existed for centuries.
                 As early as the 9th century, a programmable music 
                 sequencer was invented by the Persian Banu Musa brothers
                 , who described an automated mechanical flute player in the Book 
                 of Ingenious Devices. In 1206, the Arab engineer Al-Jazari 
                 invented a programmable drum machine where a musical mechanical automaton
                  could be made to play different rhythms and drum patterns, via pegs and cams.
                   In 1801, the Jacquard loom could produce entirely different weaves by changing the
                   "program" a series of pasteboard cards with holes punched in them.

                Code-breaking algorithms have also 
                existed for centuries. In the 9th century, 
                the Arab mathematician Al-Kindi described a cryptographic
                 algorithm for deciphering encrypted code, in A Manuscript
                  on Deciphering Cryptographic Messages. He gave the first 
                  description of cryptanalysis by frequency analysis,
                   the earliest code-breaking algorithm.</p>
